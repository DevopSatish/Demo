- The selected plan highlights based on the number of users.

- Optimized Core Web Vitals for both desktop and mobile to meet standard requirements.
- Recorded a video showcasing the core web vitals report.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevopSatish/Demo.git
   
## Core Web Vitals

I have optimized the Core Web Vitals for both desktop and mobile to ensure a smooth user experience. You can find the Lighthouse report and video recording in the Core Web Vitals directory.

## Lazy Loading

To avoid pagination, I implemented lazy loading using randomly generated JSON data. When a user reaches the end of the current results, more results are automatically loaded to provide a better user experience.

## CI/CD Pipeline

I have set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for this project. The pipeline automates the deployment process to a server. You can find the CI/CD configuration in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Demo

You can access the live demo of this project on GitHub Pages: [Demo Link](https://devopsatish.github.io/Demo/latest.html)
